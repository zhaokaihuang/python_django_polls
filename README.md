# python_django_polls
This is a beginning project for polling to test the MTV framework of Python Django 1.9.4. ***Django*** is a clean, rapid Python Web framework, which I can focus on writing my apps without reinventing wheels.

The application is supposed to have basic functions of administrating polls and letting people votes for that. <br/>
Though the features are not mature in certainty, I feed myself new ways of designing application so rapidly and pragmatically. 
During the basic use of Django, I get to understand underlying ideas of **Models**, **Templates** and **Views**.

I found below links are useful for newbies to Python Django.
